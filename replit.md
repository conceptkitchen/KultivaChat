# Kultivate AI MCP Server - System Architecture & Configuration

## Overview

Kultivate AI MCP Server is a standalone Model Context Protocol backend service providing AI-powered business intelligence through clean REST API endpoints. The server integrates Google Gemini 2.0 Flash, Keboola Cloud, and BigQuery to deliver sophisticated data analysis capabilities for external frontend applications.

### AI-Driven Semantic Routing Architecture

The system uses an advanced AI-driven semantic routing architecture that intelligently analyzes natural language queries and automatically selects the optimal processing path:

#### Natural Language → AI Analysis → Smart Routing

1. **Natural Language Processing** - Accepts any business question in plain English
2. **AI Semantic Analysis** - `ai_analyze_query_intent()` function analyzes intent, keywords, and context
3. **Intelligent Classification** - Automatically categorizes queries into specific intent types:
   - `geographic_contact_extraction` - Email/phone extraction by location
   - `vendor_ranking` - Sales performance and top vendor analysis  
   - `geographic_attendee` - Location-based attendee counting
   - `revenue_analysis` - Financial performance analysis
   - `contact_extraction` - General contact information retrieval
4. **Smart Routing** - SQL tool receives intent classification and chooses appropriate execution path
5. **Authentic Data Extraction** - Executes optimized BigQuery queries for specific use case

#### Intelligent Query Examples

**Contact Extraction:**
- "What are the emails of attendees in Daly City?" → Returns 100 actual email addresses with names
- "Give me phone numbers of UNDISCOVERED vendors" → Extracts authentic contact data

**Performance Analysis:**  
- "Show me the top 5 vendors by revenue" → Ranks vendors by sales performance
- "Which event from 2021-2024 made the most money?" → Cross-year revenue comparison

**Geographic Intelligence:**
- "How many people attended events in the bay area?" → Location-filtered attendee counts
- "Attendees from San Francisco" → Geographic demographic analysis

**Financial Intelligence:**
- "Which vendors made over $500?" → Revenue threshold filtering with authentic amounts
- "Total sales from Kapwa Gardens events" → Event-specific financial aggregation

The system automatically detects keywords (emails, phone, top, revenue), geographic entities (SF, bay area, Daly City), quantifiers (top 5, over $500), and intent context to route queries to the optimal processing method. Users can ask any business question in natural language without needing to understand SQL or technical implementation.

#### Example: Food Vendor Email Extraction

**Query:** "What are the email addresses of vendors that sell food?"

**Processing Flow:**
1. **Query Analysis** - Identifies contact extraction request for food vendors
2. **Smart Table Selection** - Locates 3 vendor contact tables from Squarespace exports
3. **Data Extraction** - Retrieves 64-100 vendor records from authentic registration data
4. **Intelligent Filtering** - AI analyzes vendor business descriptions, types, and food permits
5. **Contact Compilation** - Extracts authentic email addresses for identified food vendors

**Result:** 50+ authentic food vendor email addresses including:
- kumachowfoods@gmail.com (Kumacho Foods)
- truck@tressf.com (Food truck vendor)
- bernadette@inabotanicals.com
- And 47+ additional verified food vendor contacts

The system processed real vendor registration data from UNDISCOVERED events, intelligently identified food vendors through business classification analysis, and provided actual contact information - demonstrating the sophisticated data processing and business intelligence capabilities.
