# Kultivate AI - System Architecture & Configuration

## Overview

Kultivate AI is a full-stack chat application that combines React frontend with Python Flask backend, providing AI-powered data insights through integration with Google Gemini, Keboola Cloud, and BigQuery. The application serves as an intelligent assistant for data visualization, code generation, and API integration.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with custom theming

### Backend Architecture
- **Primary Server**: Python Flask (port 8081) for AI processing and API integrations
- **Proxy Server**: Node.js Express (port 5000) for authentication and static file serving
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash for natural language processing
- **Data Sources**: Keboola Cloud API and Google BigQuery
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL-backed session storage

### Database Layer
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL (configured via Drizzle ORM)
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle Kit for migrations and schema management
- **Tables**: Users, sessions, conversations, messages
- **Session Store**: connect-pg-simple for Express session persistence

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- **Strategy**: Passport.js with local strategy
- **Password Security**: Scrypt-based hashing with salt
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL store
- **Protection**: Protected routes with authentication middleware

### AI Processing Pipeline
- **Primary AI**: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash with function calling
- **Tools Available**: SQL query execution, Keboola bucket listing, table details, location services
- **Response Format**: Structured JSON with content and display components
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and fallback mechanisms

### Data Integration Layer
- **Keboola Storage**: API client for data bucket and table operations
- **BigQuery**: Google Cloud client for SQL query execution
- **Credentials**: Service account JSON for Google Cloud services
- **Environment Variables**: Secure configuration for API keys and tokens

### Frontend Components
- **Chat Interface**: Real-time messaging with typing indicators
- **Canvas Display**: Multi-format content rendering (text, code, tables, visualizations)
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Conversation management and history
- **Authentication UI**: Login/register forms with validation

## Data Flow

1. **User Input**: Message submitted through chat interface
2. **Authentication**: Express middleware validates user session
3. **Message Processing**: Content forwarded to Flask backend via internal API
4. **AI Processing**: Gemini processes message with available tools and context
5. **Data Retrieval**: Tools execute against Keboola/BigQuery as needed
6. **Response Generation**: AI formats response with appropriate displays
7. **Database Storage**: Conversation and messages persisted to PostgreSQL
8. **UI Update**: Frontend receives structured response and renders components
