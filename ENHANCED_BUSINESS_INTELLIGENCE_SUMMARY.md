# Enhanced Business Intelligence Capabilities - Implementation Summary

## Option 1 & 3 Implementation Complete

Your MCP server now handles all 22 business intelligence questions through enhanced natural language processing and extended tool capabilities.

## Enhanced Features Implemented

### 1. Demographics Detection & Filtering
**Patterns Added:**
- Identity-based: middle eastern, asian, latino, black, white, native, pacific islander
- Gender-based: female, male, non-binary
- Automatic SQL WHERE clause generation for demographic filtering

**Example Queries Handled:**
- "Which vendors who identify as Middle Eastern made more than $500?"
- "Which Balay Kreative applicants identify as X?"

### 2. Income/Sales Threshold Processing
**Operators Supported:**
- "more than $X" → greater than
- "less than $X" → less than  
- "at least $X" → greater than or equal to

**Example Queries Handled:**
- "vendors that make less than $X income"
- "attendees who gave more than $1 from 2021-2024"

### 3. Contact Information Extraction
**Fields Detected:**
- Email addresses with validation
- Phone numbers (cell, mobile, phone)
- Multi-field contact queries

**Example Queries Handled:**
- "What are the email addresses of vendors that sell X?"
- "What are the cell #'s of vendors that participated in Yum Yams?"

### 4. Multi-Event Participation Analysis
**Cross-Event Detection:**
- Kapwa Gardens + UNDSCVRD participation
- Balay Kreative + other events
- Event frequency thresholds ("more than 2x")

**Example Queries Handled:**
- "Which vendors participated in Kapwa Gardens and UNDSCVRD events from 2020-2023?"
- "Who applied to Balay Kreative Grant and went to events more than 2x?"

### 5. Grant Application Correlation
**Advanced Analytics:**
- Links grant applicants to event attendance
- Cross-references application data with participation records
- Demographic filtering for grant recipients

**Example Queries Handled:**
- "Who applied to Balay Kreative Grant and went to our events more than 2x?"
- "Which Balay Kreative applicants live in Daly City?"

### 6. Enhanced Geographic Analysis
**Location Processing:**
- SF/San Francisco zip code mapping
- Daly City specific filtering
- Multi-city analysis with transaction data

**Example Queries Handled:**
- "How many attendees live in SF and Daly City?"
- "What Zip code are our vendors from who participated from 2020-2023?"

curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "Which vendors who identify as Middle Eastern made more than $500 from 2020-2023?"}'

# All 22 business intelligence questions now work
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "Who applied to Balay Kreative Grant and went to our events more than 2x?"}'
```
