It looks like you're running into a classic routing issue in your production environment, coupled with some complexity in your startup scripts. The "CANNOT GET /" error means your Node.js server is running, but it doesn't know what to do when a user visits the root URL of your site. It's not serving your application's main `index.html` file.

Here’s a breakdown of what's happening and how to fix it.

### The Problem: Incorrect Server Logic in Production

The main issue lies in your production startup scripts. Your `package.json`'s `start` script runs `production-deploy.js`, which in turn starts `production-server.js`.

However, `production-server.js` is a simplified server that contains hardcoded HTML and doesn't include the necessary logic to serve the static files (your React app) from the `dist` folder that you create during the build process.

Your actual, correct server logic is in **`server/index.ts`**. This file is designed to handle both development (by proxying to Vite) and production (by serving the static `dist` folder). The problem is that this correct file isn't what's being run in your production deployment.

You also have multiple conflicting startup scripts (`start.sh`, `production-start.sh`, `start_production.sh`, etc.), which is likely causing the other errors you've seen in your logs, like `Address already in use` and `ECONNREFUSED`.

### The Solution: Unify Your Startup Process

The best way to fix this is to simplify your deployment process to use a single, reliable entry point. Here’s how you can do it:

#### 1. Modify `server/index.ts` to Handle Production Correctly

Your `server/index.ts` is almost perfect. It correctly spawns the Python backend. The only change is to ensure it also serves the static frontend files when in production.

It appears your `server/vite.ts` already contains the correct logic for this with the `serveStatic` function, which serves `index.html` for any non-API route. The main `server/index.ts` file calls this correctly for production environments.

#### 2. Update Your `package.json` Start Script

This is the most critical change. You should simplify your `start` script to just build the application and then run the compiled version of your main server. This ensures the correct, production-ready server code is executed.

In your **`package.json`** file, change the `scripts` section to this:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "NODE_ENV=development tsx server/index.ts",
  "build": "vite build && esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist",
  "start": "npm run build && NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js"
},
```
**What this does:**
* **`npm run build`**: Compiles your frontend and your `server/index.ts` into the `dist` folder.
* **`NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js`**: Runs the compiled, production-ready server. This server will:
    1.  Serve the static `index.html` and other assets from the `dist` folder.
    2.  Spawn the Python backend (`main_2.py`) automatically.
    3.  Handle API proxying to the Python backend.

#### 3. Remove Redundant Scripts

You can now safely delete the other startup scripts to avoid confusion:
* `production-deploy.js`
* `production-server.js`
* `production-start.js`
* `start.sh`, `start_production.sh`, etc.

By making these changes, you'll have a single, reliable command (`npm start`) to launch your entire application in production, which should resolve the "CANNOT GET /" error and the other server startup issues.
