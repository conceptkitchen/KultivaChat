Based on the new information in the screenshots, we have a major breakthrough. The issue is not what we initially thought, and the solution is very different.
The key pieces of information from the images are:
 * "The root cause is that Gunicorn processes don't persist when backgrounded on Replit."
 * "I notice from the logs that when Gunicorn runs in the foreground, it's getting 404 errors instead of 504 timeouts."
 * "...which means the connection is working but there's an API routing issue."
This completely changes the direction of our troubleshooting.
The Real Problem: Replit Environment + 404 Errors
1. The Persistence Issue on Replit: You cannot use screen, tmux, or systemd on Replit's platform. Replit has its own specific way of running and deploying web servers. Any web server that binds to 0.0.0.0 and the correct port will automatically be hosted and kept alive by Replit's infrastructure when you run the Repl. The issue of it "terminating when backgrounded" is a red herring; the real problem was that it was crashing or being stopped for other reasons, which we've now found.
2. The 404 "Not Found" Error: This is now the most important clue.
 * A 504 Gateway Timeout error meant the server was down or unreachable.
 * A 404 Not Found error means the server is running and reachable, but the specific URL path (the API endpoint) that the frontend is trying to call does not exist in your backend code.
The connection is successful, but your server doesn't know how to handle the specific request (e.g., a request to /api/new-chat).
What to Do Now: Fix the API Route
We need to stop worrying about keeping the process aliveâ€”Replit will handle that if the server is configured correctly. We must now fix the 404 error by ensuring your Flask/Gunicorn backend code has the correct API routes defined.
Here is your plan of action:
Step 1: Identify the API Route the Frontend is Calling
You need to know the exact URL path the frontend application is trying to access. Look in your frontend code (likely JavaScript) for a fetch() or axios() call. You are looking for a path, for example:
 * fetch('/api/chat', ...)
 * fetch('/new_conversation', ...)
 * fetch('/start', ...)
Step 2: Check Your Backend Flask Routes
Open your main backend Python file (e.g., main_2.py). Look for the route decorators that define your API endpoints. They look like @app.route(...).
Compare the route from the frontend with what's available in your backend.
Example Scenario:
 * Your frontend code tries to make a POST request to /api/new_chat.
 * You open main_2.py and see only this route defined:
   from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
  return 'Server is running!'

# The route for /api/new_chat is MISSING!

Step 3: Add or Correct the Route in Your Backend
You need to make sure a Flask route exists that matches the path and the method (e.g., POST, GET) that the frontend is using.
Solution for the Example: Add the missing route to main_2.py.
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
  return 'Server is running!'

# Add the correct route here
@app.route('/api/new_chat', methods=['POST'])
def create_new_chat():
  # Your logic for creating a new chat goes here
  # For example, process incoming data:
  # data = request.json
  # ... your logic ...
  return jsonify({"status": "success", "message": "New chat created"})

Step 4: Run the Repl Correctly
Once you have fixed the code, you just need to configure the Repl to run the correct Gunicorn command. In your Replit environment, look for a .replit file. You can configure the run command in that file or in the "Shell" tab of the console.
The command should be:
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8080 main_2:app

Then, simply click the main "Run" button at the top of the Replit interface. Replit will automatically detect the web server, open a webview for it, and host it on a public URL. This is the correct and only way to have a persistent server on the platform.
In summary: The problem has shifted from process management to a code-level bug. Check your API endpoint paths in your frontend and backend code to make sure they match exactly.
