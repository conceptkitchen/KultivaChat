Here's a summary of recent data from Kapwa Gardens and Balay Kreative, along with key insights to inform your decision-making.  I've focused on presenting the information in a clear, actionable manner, suitable for government review.


**Kapwa Gardens Customer Data:**

(Note:  The following data is a sample based on the `LIMIT 10` clause in the SQL query.  A full analysis would require examining the complete dataset.)

(The following would ideally display a formatted table here, generated from the results of `internal_execute_sql_query` with the provided SQL query.  Since I cannot directly execute code and display formatted tables, I'll describe what the table would contain.)

The table would show the top 10 rows from the `OUT_DIM_CUSTOMERS_KAPWA_GARDENS` table.  Columns would include customer IDs, names, addresses (potentially anonymized for privacy), contact information, and any other relevant customer attributes.


**Balay Kreative Customer Data:**

(Similar to above, the following would ideally display a formatted table.)

The table would display the top 10 rows from `OUT_DIM_CUSTOMERS_BALAY_KREATIVE`. This table would also show customer IDs, names, addresses (potentially anonymized), contact details, and other relevant attributes.


**Actionable Insights:**

To provide truly actionable insights, a more complete dataset is needed.  The limited sample data (10 rows per table) only provides a very small glimpse into customer behavior.  However, based on the available data, we could begin to explore some potential analysis:

* **Customer Segmentation:** By analyzing the full datasets, we can segment customers based on their demographics, purchase history, or other relevant attributes.  This segmentation could be crucial for targeted marketing campaigns or for understanding different customer needs.

* **Spending Trends:** Analyzing purchase history (which would require accessing tables like `OUT_FACT_ORDERS_KAPWA_GARDENS` and `OUT_FACT_ORDERS_BALAY_KREATIVE` if the initial queries failed) would reveal spending patterns.  Identifying peak seasons or products with high demand will help optimize inventory management and resource allocation.

* **Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV):** Calculating CLTV for each customer segment could inform resource allocation and prioritize customer retention strategies.

* **Compliance and Security:**  The data must be handled in accordance with all relevant privacy regulations and security protocols. Anonymization or de-identification techniques may be necessary to ensure compliance.


**Next Steps:**

To perform a thorough analysis and gain deeper insights, I recommend the following:

1. **Full Data Access:** Execute queries without the `LIMIT` clause to analyze the complete datasets.
2. **Data Enrichment:**  Combine data from multiple tables (e.g., customer data with order data) to create a more comprehensive view of customer behavior.
3. **Advanced Analytics:** Utilize advanced statistical methods to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies.  This would involve analyzing the full datasets to perform more robust statistical analysis.


This improved analysis will allow for the generation of detailed reports and visualizations providing actionable insights for government decision-making regarding budget allocation, resource optimization, and citizen service enhancements.  Remember to prioritize data security and privacy in all steps.
