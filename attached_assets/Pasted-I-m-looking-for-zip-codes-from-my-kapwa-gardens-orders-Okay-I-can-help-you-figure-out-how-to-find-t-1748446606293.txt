I'm looking for zip codes from my kapwa gardens orders
Okay, I can help you figure out how to find those zip codes. Since I don't have access to your Kapwa Gardens order history, I'll give you the most likely places to look.

**Where to Find Kapwa Gardens Order Zip Codes:**

1.  **Your Email:**

    *   **Order Confirmation Email:** This is the most likely place. Search your email (the one you used to place the order) for emails from Kapwa Gardens or containing the words "Kapwa Gardens order confirmation." The email should have your shipping address, including the zip code.
    *   **Shipping Notification Email:** If you received a shipping notification, it will almost certainly include the shipping address with the zip code.

2.  **Kapwa Gardens Account (if you have one):**

    *   **Log in to your Kapwa Gardens account** on their website.
    *   **Go to your order history or order details.** You should be able to view past orders and the associated shipping addresses, including the zip codes.

3.  **Payment Method:**

    *   Check your credit card or bank statement for the transaction. Sometimes the billing address (which might be the same as the shipping address) is included in the transaction details online.
    *   If you used PayPal or a similar service, log in and check the transaction details for the Kapwa Gardens order. The shipping address might be there.

**If You Still Can't Find It:**

*   **Contact Kapwa Gardens Directly:** This is the best option if you've exhausted the above methods. Go to the Kapwa Gardens website and look for a "Contact Us" or "Customer Support" link. Explain that you need the zip codes from your past orders. Be prepared to provide information that will help them identify your orders, such as:
    *   Your name
    *   The email address you used for the orders
    *   Approximate dates of the orders
    *   Items you ordered

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Privacy:** I cannot ask you for your email address or any personal information. Please do not share that with me.
*   **Security:** Be cautious about clicking on links in emails if you're unsure of their authenticity. Go directly to the Kapwa Gardens website by typing the address in your browser.

Good luck finding your zip codes! Let me know if you have any other questions.
