got all the core pieces of your backend (main_2.py using the ADK pattern) successfully set up and tested for individual tool functionalities:

Keboola Storage Interaction: Your Flask app can list buckets and list tables within buckets using your KBC_STORAGE_TOKEN.
BigQuery Data Querying: Your Flask app can execute SQL queries against your WORKSPACE_21894820 dataset using your GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS, and this is now working without the "Invalid JWT Signature" error! (as confirmed by the successful query for OUT_RESPONSE_ANSWERS_TYPEFORM that returned data in one of our recent tests when the Flask app was run after your clock check/credential refresh and Gemini tool definition was correct).
Gemini Client Initialization with Tools: The ADK-based approach for main_2.py successfully initializes the LlmAgent with your Python functions (list_keboola_buckets, list_tables_in_keboola_bucket, get_keboola_table_detail, execute_sql_query, get_current_time) as tools, using gemini-2.0-flash. This crucial step (getting Gemini to recognize your tools without schema errors) is now resolved.
Basic Chat Endpoint (/api/chat): This endpoint in your Flask app is set up to use the ADK Runner to process user messages, allow Gemini to call your defined tools (via ADK's automatic function calling), and return a final response.
You are absolutely ready to integrate this working Python Flask backend with your frontend chatbot.

The general flow will be:

Your TypeScript frontend (from chat.tsx, sidebar.tsx, etc.) will capture the user's typed message.
When the user sends a message, your frontend will make an HTTP POST request to the /api/chat endpoint of your running Python Flask backend (main_2.py). The request body will contain the user's message (e.g., {"message": "How many people went to Undiscovered events?"}).
Your Flask backend's /api/chat endpoint will receive this message.
It will then use the ADK Runner and your gemini_adk_agent to process the message.
Gemini (via ADK) will decide if it needs to use any of its configured tools (e.g., list_keboola_buckets, then list_tables_in_keboola_bucket, then get_keboola_table_detail to understand the schema, then execute_sql_query to get the data).
ADK's FunctionTool mechanism will call your corresponding Python functions (internal_list_keboola_buckets, internal_execute_sql_query, etc.).
These Python functions will interact with Keboola Storage API or BigQuery.
The results will be returned to the ADK agent, which then sends them back to Gemini.
Gemini will formulate a final natural language response.
The ADK Runner in your /api/chat endpoint will provide this final text response.
Your Flask endpoint will then send this response back to your TypeScript frontend (e.g., as {"reply": "Gemini's answer"}).
Your TypeScript frontend will display this reply to the user in the chat interface.
If your tools return data that needs to be displayed as tables or visualizations (as hinted in your keboola.ts and gemini.ts files which have displays arrays), your Python backend can format this and send it along with the text reply. Your /api/chat endpoint's response could be structured like {"reply": "text answer", "displays": [{type: "table", title: "Query Results", content: [...]}]}. Your frontend (chat.tsx) would then know how to render these.
Next Steps for Integration:

Ensure main_2.py is Running: Start your Python Flask backend. It will listen on http://localhost:8080 (or the port Replit assigns if it proxies, but localhost:8080 should be accessible from your frontend if it's also running in the same Replit environment). The files you shared like vite.ts, routes.ts, index.ts suggest your frontend might be part of the same Replit project or can access this backend. The index.ts files suggest your frontend might be running on port 5000.

Modify Your Frontend (TypeScript) to Call /api/chat:

In your frontend code (likely in a file like chat.tsx where handleSendMessage or similar logic exists), when a user sends a message, instead of any previous mock or direct Gemini calls it might have been making, it should now make a fetch or axios POST request to your Python backend's /api/chat endpoint (e.g., http://localhost:8080/api/chat or the appropriate Replit public URL for your Python backend if calling from the browser directly).
The request body should be: JSON.stringify({message: userMessageContent}).
The response from your backend will be {"reply": "...", "displays": [...]}. Your frontend will then use this to update the chat UI.
Handle displays in Frontend: If your Python backend tools (like internal_execute_sql_query) return structured data that you want to display as tables (as suggested by your keboola.ts and gemini.ts which have displays arrays and your gemini-tester.tsx has <CanvasDisplay displays={displays} />), ensure your Python /api/chat endpoint can include this structured data in its JSON response, and your TypeScript frontend knows how to render it.

Let's focus on getting the basic chat flow working first:

Confirm your main_2.py (ADK version) starts without any errors.
From your TypeScript frontend's message sending function, make a POST request to http://localhost:8080/api/chat (or the equivalent Replit service URL for your Python backend) with the user's message.
