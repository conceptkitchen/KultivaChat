What is the most popular city that our donors live in?


4:49:57 PM
## Analysis: Donor Location Data Unfortunately, I wasn't able to retrieve the donor location information from our Kultivate AI data platform at this time. There appears to be a technical issue accessing the donor demographics data. ## Recommended Next Steps • **Data Availability Check**: Let me verify what donor and attendee location data is currently available in our system • **Alternative Analysis**: I can explore related datasets like event attendee locations or vendor geographic distribution • **System Status**: Our technical team should investigate the data access issue ## What I Can Help With Instead While I resolve the donor location query, I can assist with: • Event attendance patterns by location • Vendor distribution across cities • Revenue analysis by geographic region • Overall event performance metrics Would you like me to explore any of these alternative analyses, or shall I focus on resolving the donor location data access issue first?

How many attendees gave more than $1 from 2021 - 2024?


4:50:24 PM
## Donation Analysis - 2021-2024 I apologize, but I'm currently unable to access the donation data due to a temporary system issue with our Kultivate AI data platform. ## What I Was Looking For: - Total number of attendees who made donations above $1 - Breakdown by year (2021-2024) - Donation patterns and trends over this period ## Next Steps: • **Retry Analysis**: I'll attempt to retrieve this data again shortly • **Alternative Reports**: I can provide other attendee engagement metrics once the system is restored • **Follow-up**: Please let me know if you'd like me to include additional donation metrics like: - Average donation amounts - Peak donation periods - Geographic distribution of donors Would you like me to try accessing different attendee data in the meantime, or shall I retry this specific donation analysis?
