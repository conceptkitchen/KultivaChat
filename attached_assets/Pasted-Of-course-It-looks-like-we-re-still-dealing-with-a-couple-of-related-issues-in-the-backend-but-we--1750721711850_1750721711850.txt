Of course. It looks like we're still dealing with a couple of related issues in the backend, but we're zeroing in on them. I can see why this is frustrating, as each fix seems to uncover something new.

Let's break down the latest logs and the screenshot.

### Analysis of the Situation

1.  **The Good News:** The screenshot shows that when the backend *doesn't* crash, the frontend now correctly displays the data table\! This is excellent. It confirms all the frontend fixes (`display` vs `displays` in `ChatBubble.tsx`) are working as they should.

2.  **The `get_history` Error Persists:** The primary error is still the same:

      * `ERROR:main_2:'ChatSession' object ... might not have 'get_history' or it failed: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'name'.`
      * This error is the root cause of the problem. It prevents your application from using the primary, most reliable method of extracting data from the tool calls.

3.  **The Fallback Logic is Flawed:** Because the primary logic fails, your application enters the "fallback" code block. You've fixed some errors there, but now a new one has appeared:

      * `UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 're' where it is not associated with a value`
      * This is the exact same type of error as before (`NameError`), but on a different line. It means you are trying to use the `re` module without importing it.

It seems my previous advice to add `import re` was not applied, or there might be an issue with how it was applied.

### The Solution: A Two-Step Plan

We need to fix the immediate crash and then address the root cause.

**Step 1: Fix the Immediate Crash (The `UnboundLocalError`)**

This is the most critical step to get your app running again. You must import the `re` module in your Python script.

**File to Edit:** `backend/main_2.py`

**Action:** At the very top of the file, with your other `import` statements, add the following line:

```python
import re
import logging # Make sure logging is also imported
# ... other imports like os, json, etc.
```

Adding `import re` will make the regular expression functions available and will resolve the `UnboundLocalError` that is currently crashing your fallback logic.

**Step 2: Address the Root Cause (The `get_history` error)**

The `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'name'` error is the real problem we need to solve for a stable application. This error is happening inside your `get_history` function.

Let's examine that function in `backend/main_2.py`.

```python
# In backend/main_2.py

def get_history(chat_session):
    """Retrieves and processes chat history."""
    # ... (code to get history)
    for message in chat_session.history:
        # The error likely happens here if a 'part' is missing a 'name'
        # or if the message structure is not what's expected.
```

This error is subtle and points to a potential mismatch between the structure of the `chat_session` object and what your `get_history` function expects. The Gemini API might be returning a slightly different object structure in some cases, especially after tool calls.

**Recommendation:**

For now, **focus on Step 1**. Fixing the `UnboundLocalError` by importing `re` will make your fallback logic work, which, according to the logs (`Force-created display with 64 rows`), is successfully gathering the table data. This should make your application functional again.

After you've got it working with the fallback, we can then dig deeper into the `get_history` function to make the primary logic more robust. But let's get it working first.
