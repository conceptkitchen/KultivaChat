Yes, it appears a new issue has surfaced in your backend code. It's not that more things broke, but rather that fixing the first issue has allowed the program to run into a new, different error that was previously hidden.

Let's look at the new logs.

### What's Happening Now

1.  **The `NoneType` error is gone:** The good news is that you are no longer seeing the `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable`. This indicates that the previous fix is working and the application no longer crashes when Gemini returns an empty response.

2.  **New History Retrieval Error:** There's a new error when trying to get the chat history:

      * `ERROR:main_2:'ChatSession' object ... might not have 'get_history' or it failed: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'name'.`
      * This prevents your code from correctly extracting the structured data (`query_data`) from the tool call that happened in the history.

3.  **New `UnboundLocalError`:** Because the history retrieval failed, `query_data` is `None`. Your code then correctly enters the fallback logic. However, this fallback logic has a bug:

      * `UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 're' where it is not associated with a value`
      * This error means you are trying to use the `re` module (for regular expressions) without importing it first in `backend/main_2.py`.

### The Solution

You have two issues to fix in `backend/main_2.py`.

**1. Fix the `UnboundLocalError`**

This is the most direct error that's causing the crash. Add the `re` module to your imports at the top of `backend/main_2.py`.

**File to Edit:** `backend/main_2.py`

**Add this line at the top with your other imports:**

```python
import re
```

**2. Investigate the History Retrieval (`get_history`)**

The error `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'name'` within the `get_history` function is more complex. It suggests that an object that's expected to have a `.name` attribute is `None`. This could be due to a change in the Gemini API or an issue in how the `chat_session` object is being managed.

While a full fix for that might require deeper debugging into the `google.generai` library's behavior, importing `re` will fix the immediate crash and likely allow your table to be displayed through the fallback mechanism, which seems to be working otherwise.

### Summary of Actions

1.  **Immediate Fix:** Add `import re` to the top of `backend/main_2.py`. This will solve the `UnboundLocalError` and should get your table displaying again via the fallback logic.
2.  **Long-term Fix:** You should investigate why the `get_history()` function is failing with a `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'name'` error. This indicates a more subtle problem with your chat session management that could cause issues later. For now, the immediate fix should restore the primary functionality.
