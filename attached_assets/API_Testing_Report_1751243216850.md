# API Testing Report: Multi-Table Business Intelligence API

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive report on the testing of the Multi-Table Business Intelligence API. The tests were designed to evaluate various complex queries and their responses in the context of the API's functionality.

## Key Queries Tested

1. **Revenue Threshold Analysis**  
   - **Query**: "Which Kapwa Gardens vendors made over $500?"  
   - **Response**:  `{"error":"'table_name'"}`  
   - **Issue**: This response indicates a problem with the query, likely due to a missing or incorrect table name in the backend.

2. **Multi-event Participation Tracking**  
   - **Query**: "Show me vendors who participated in multiple Kapwa Gardens events"  
   - **Response**:  `{"error":"'table_name'"}`  
   - **Issue**: Again, this shows an error related to the table name, preventing successful query execution.

3. **Performance Trend Analysis**  
   - **Query**: "How has Kapwa Gardens revenue changed over time?"  
   - **Response**:  `{"error":"'table_name'"}`  
   - **Issue**: This error suggests similar problems with querying the appropriate tables.

4. **Comprehensive Business Intelligence Query**  
   - **Query**: "Show me comprehensive Kapwa Gardens business intelligence"  
   - **Response**:  
   ```json
   {"status": "success", "query_executed": "SELECT table_name, table_type, creation_time FROM `kbc-use4-839-261b.WORKSPACE_23990909.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES` ORDER BY table_name", "tables": [...], "additional_info": "showing multiple table details..."}
   ```  
   - **Details**: This query executed successfully and returned a comprehensive list of tables within the database, alongside their types and creation times.

## Summary

- The initial three queries resulted in errors related to the 'table_name', indicating potential misconfigurations or missing information in the API.
- The fourth query was successful and provided useful details about the tables in the database, indicating that the API functions correctly in some contexts.

## Recommendations
To resolve the errors returned from the first three queries:
1. Investigate the API's documentation for correct query formats.
2. Ensure that the necessary tables exist and are accessible to these queries.

This report aims to assist developers and stakeholders in understanding the current functionality of the Multi-Table Business Intelligence API and advising on necessary next steps for continued development.
