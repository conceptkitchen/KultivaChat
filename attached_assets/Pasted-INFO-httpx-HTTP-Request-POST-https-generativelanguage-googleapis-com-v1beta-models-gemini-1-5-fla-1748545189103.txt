INFO:main_2:Gemini final answer (genai.Client/chat): I apologize, but I encountered an error while trying to access the `OUT_DIM_CUSTOMERS` table:  `Error getting table detail for out.c-customers.OUT_DIM_CUSTOMERS: 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://connection.us-east4.gcp.keboola.com/v2/storage/tables/out.c-customers.OUT_DIM_CUSTOMERS`.  This suggests that the table either doesn't exist or there's an issue with the table ID or access permissions. Could you please double-check the table name or provide additional details about the bucket it belongs to?  Knowing the bucket ID (`in.c-something` or `out.c-something`) would help me locate the table.
