Based on our Phase 1 discussion and the requirements of the Keboola MCP Server, here are the secrets you will need to set up in your Replit project's "Secrets" manager:

KBC_STORAGE_TOKEN

What it is: Your Keboola Project Storage API Token.
Its Value: This is the token string you generated from within your Keboola project's settings (the one that looked like 839-642196-7otbn5BJVvB57HOxHtLnfvsaqtdbs3PkPyNPPvpl).
Purpose: Allows the MCP Server to authenticate with your Keboola project's Storage API to get information like table lists, metadata, etc.
KBC_WORKSPACE_SCHEMA

What it is: The "Dataset Name" of your Keboola BigQuery Workspace (which you named "KL_Query").
Its Value: This is WORKSPACE_21894820, which you found in the "Workspace Credentials" dialog in Keboola.
Purpose: Tells the MCP Server which BigQuery dataset (schema) within your Keboola-managed BigQuery backend contains your tables to be queried.
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS

What it is: This secret will hold the path to the Google Cloud JSON credentials file that you downloaded from your Keboola BigQuery Workspace.
Its Value:
First, make sure you have uploaded the JSON file (e.g., credentials-839-21894808.json) into your Replit project's file explorer. You can place it in the main (root) directory of your Replit project.
The value for this secret will then be the name of the file if it's in the root (e.g., credentials-839-21894808.json) or the full path to the file within your Replit environment if you placed it in a subdirectory (e.g., /home/runner/YOUR_REPLIT_PROJECT_NAME/credentials-839-21894808.json). You can typically just use the filename if it's in the root of where your server will run.
Purpose: Allows the MCP Server to authenticate directly with Google BigQuery to execute SQL queries against the dataset managed by your Keboola BigQuery Workspace.
KBC_API_URL

What it is: The API URL for your specific Keboola region.
Its Value: https://connection.us-east4.gcp.keboola.com (We identified this from your earlier screenshots).
Purpose: Tells the MCP Server which Keboola regional endpoint to communicate with.
