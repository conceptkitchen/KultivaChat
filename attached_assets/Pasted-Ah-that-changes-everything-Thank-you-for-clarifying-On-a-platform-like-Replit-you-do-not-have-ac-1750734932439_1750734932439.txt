Ah, that changes everything! Thank you for clarifying.
On a platform like Replit, you do not have access to system-level tools like systemd. The entire environment is managed differently. You cannot use the previous systemd solution.
Replit has its own specific way to ensure a backend service persists. The problem is the same—a standard "Run" command will stop when you close the tab—but the solution is built into the Replit platform.
Here is how you make your main_2.py backend persist on Replit.
Step 1: Configure the Run Command in .replit
First, you need to tell Replit how to run your backend correctly as a web server. You do this in the hidden .replit file.
 * Find the .replit file: In the file explorer pane on the left, click the three-dot menu icon (⋮) and select "Show hidden files". This will reveal the .replit file. Click on it to open it.
 * Set the run command: You need to edit the [run] section to start a production-ready server that listens on the correct host and port for Replit. The best practice is to use gunicorn.
   Your .replit file should look like this:
   # In the .replit file

entrypoint = "main_2.py"

[run]
# This command tells Replit how to start your web server
command = ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8080", "main_2:app"]

# If you get an error, it's possible your Repl needs this instead:
# command = ["poetry", "run", "gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8080", "main_2:app"]

Explanation of the command:
 * gunicorn: The production web server. If you haven't installed it, go to the "Shell" tab and run pip install gunicorn.
 * --bind 0.0.0.0:8080: This is critical for Replit.
   * 0.0.0.0 tells the server to listen for requests from outside its container.
   * 8080 is a standard port that Replit listens to.
 * main_2:app: This tells Gunicorn to run the app object (your Flask or FastAPI instance) from the main_2.py file.
After configuring this, press the main "Run" button at the top. A "Webview" window should open on the right, showing that your server is running and accessible.
Step 2: Enable Persistence with "Always On"
This is the key Replit feature for keeping your backend alive. "Always On" is a paid feature that ensures your Repl's server doesn't go to sleep.
 * Stop your Repl from running.
 * Click on the name of your Repl at the top-center of the screen. A dropdown menu will appear.
 * Find the "Always On" toggle switch and turn it on.
Alternatively, you may find it in the "Power-Ups" section of your Repl.
What "Always On" Does:
 * Prevents Sleeping: It stops your Repl from going into a "sleep" state after a period of inactivity.
 * Automatic Restarts: It ensures your deployment automatically wakes up and responds to requests. If your server process crashes, Replit will often restart it when a new web request comes in.
Your Complete Replit Workflow:
 * Install Dependencies: Make sure your pyproject.toml file (or requirements.txt) lists gunicorn and your web framework (like Flask). Replit will install these automatically.
 * Configure .replit: Set the [run] command to use gunicorn as shown above.
 * Test: Press "Run" to confirm your backend starts correctly and the Webview works.
 * Persist: Turn on the "Always On" feature for your Repl.
Now, your backend server will be persistently running on Replit, accessible via its URL, and it will no longer be tied to your browser tab being open.
