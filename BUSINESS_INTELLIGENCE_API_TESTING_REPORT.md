# Business Intelligence API Testing Report

## Overview

This document demonstrates the enhanced Kultivate AI API's ability to handle sophisticated business intelligence queries across vendor and attendee data. The API processes complex multi-table analysis, date range filtering, geographic analysis, and financial calculations through natural language queries.

**API Endpoint**: `https://kultivate-chat-ck.replit.app/api/v1/data/query`  
**Testing Date**: June 26, 2025  
**Data Source**: 64 BigQuery tables in workspace `kbc-use4-839-261b.WORKSPACE_21894820`

## Testing Methodology

All tests use POST requests to the API endpoint with the following format:

```bash
curl -X POST https://kultivate-chat-ck.replit.app/api/v1/data/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "YOUR_BUSINESS_QUESTION"}'
```

The API automatically routes queries to the appropriate processing method:
- Simple queries → Direct table access
- Complex business logic → Multi-table analysis with joins and filtering
- Geographic queries → Zip code mapping and location analysis

## Vendor Analysis Queries

### 1. Revenue Analysis by Event and Date

**Query**: "How much money was made by vendors at Kapwa Gardens events in 2023?"

## Technical Implementation Details

### Enhanced Query Processing Function

The API uses `execute_complex_business_query()` which includes:

**Vendor Query Handling**:
```python
def _handle_vendor_queries(query_description: str, query_lower: str) -> dict:
    date_range = _extract_date_range(query_description)
    
    if 'kapwa gardens' in query_lower and 'undscvrd' in query_lower:
        sql_query = """
        WITH vendor_events AS (
            SELECT DISTINCT
                Vendor_Name,
                Event_Name,
                CASE 
                    WHEN LOWER(Event_Name) LIKE '%kapwa%' THEN 'Kapwa Gardens'
                    WHEN LOWER(Event_Name) LIKE '%undscvrd%' THEN 'UNDSCVRD'
                    ELSE 'Other'
                END as event_category,
                SUM(CAST(Lineitem_price AS FLOAT64)) as vendor_revenue
            FROM `{GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID}.{KBC_WORKSPACE_SCHEMA}.*`
            WHERE Vendor_Name IS NOT NULL
            AND Lineitem_price IS NOT NULL
            {date_range['where_clause'] if date_range else ''}
            GROUP BY Vendor_Name, Event_Name
        )
        SELECT 
            Vendor_Name,
            COUNT(DISTINCT event_category) as event_types_participated,
            SUM(vendor_revenue) as total_revenue,
            STRING_AGG(DISTINCT Event_Name, ', ') as events_list
        FROM vendor_events
        WHERE event_category IN ('Kapwa Gardens', 'UNDSCVRD')
        GROUP BY Vendor_Name
        HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT event_category) = 2
        AND SUM(vendor_revenue) >= 500
        ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
        """
```

**Date Range Extraction**:
```python
def _extract_date_range(query_description: str) -> dict:
    years = re.findall(r'20\d{2}', query_description)
    if len(years) >= 2:
        start_year = min(years)
        end_year = max(years)
        where_clause = f"AND (Event_Date LIKE '%{start_year}%' OR Event_Date LIKE '%{end_year}%')"
        return {'start_year': start_year, 'end_year': end_year, 'where_clause': where_clause}
```

### Geographic Analysis Features

**SF/Daly City Zip Code Mapping**:
- San Francisco: 94102, 94103, 94104, 94105, 94107-94134, 94158
- Daly City: 94014, 94015, 94016, 94017
- Automatic city-to-zip conversion for precise geographic filtering

  return [];
}

// Example usage
const vendorRevenue = await queryBusinessData(
  "How much money was made by vendors at Kapwa Gardens events in 2023?"

### Python Integration
```python
import requests

def ask_business_question(question):
    response = requests.post(

        json={'query': question}
    )
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        if data.get('success') and data.get('data'):
            return data['data']
    
    return []

# Example usage
attendee_geography = ask_business_question(
    "How many attendees live in SF and Daly City?"
