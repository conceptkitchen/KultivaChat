## üîç How the MCP Workflow Works

1. **Query Processing**: Natural language query analyzed by AI intent system
2. **Table Discovery**: System discovers 35+ authentic vendor revenue tables
3. **Smart Filtering**: Tables ranked by event name and date matching (score 66 = perfect match)
4. **Data Extraction**: Authentic BigQuery revenue calculations from close-out sales data
5. **Response Format**: Total revenue, vendor count, average, min/max with table source
